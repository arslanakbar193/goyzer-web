The green initiatives by the Government of UAE are focusing on Abu Dhabi and Dubai to shape new developments. In the year 2025, the first thing to focus on in this regard is to focus on the emerging trends in real estate.

                        <h5 class="mb-2">1.Due Diligence and Research</h5>
                        <p class="pl-2">Before making any successful investment, one needs to carry out thorough research. Knowing the market trends, legal framework, and property laws in Dubai will help you in making informed decisions. To simplify navigation of the market they partner with a real estate consultant. Foreigners can buy property (areas/freehold zones) while investing. But for that, they need to be familiar with the rules of ownership. Goyzer is the platform that can help you check the rental demand and the property prices. </p>
                        <p class="pl-2">It is important to choose a reliable developer if you are interested in off-plan properties. This way you can also enjoy flexible payment plans with the off-plan properties. Even though you do not have to worry about property tax, you have to check significant service charges. Therefore, keep your focus and attention on an extra cost in the budget. </p>
                        <h5 class="mb-2">2.Work with Local Agents</h5>
                        <p class="pl-2">Having a company of experienced local agents is invaluable. This is particularly true for those who are starting out dealing with Dubai’s market. They help ensure smooth transactions and provide insights into high-performing areas. While choosing an agent check their RERA and DLD licensing. This will let you know about their track record in their chosen area. Enquire them about their key regulations and market trends to know about their experience. </p>
                        <h5 class="mb-2">3.Financial Planning</h5>
                        <p class="pl-2">To align your investment with long-term goals, good financial planning is considered important. Be aware of associated costs, mortgage options, and payment plans to confirm whether you have a realistic strategy or not. Specifically, for Dubai, include developer fees, registration fees, and service charges as 4% additional costs.</p>
                        <h5 class="mb-2">4.Challenges and Opportunities</h5>
                        <p class="pl-2">While the real estate market in UAE is profitable, challenges such as managing oversupply in certain segments and maintaining affordability for mid-income buyers are a challenge. But, such challenges also come with chances for forward-thinking solutions, for example, sustainable urban planning, mixed-use developments, and flexible payment plans.</p>
                        <h1 class="mb-2">Conclusion</h1>
                        <p class="pl-2" style="">Whether you are an interested individual, a developer, or an investor, to remain in the real estate market you have to know about industry shifts.
